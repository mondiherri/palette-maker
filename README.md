# palette-maker
Generate a palette of distinct colors for highlights, in okLCH space (see https://oklch.com/ ) 

This is intended particularly for hightlighting text in different colors.
I use okLCH space because more colors can be defined in okLCH than in RGB.
Generate a palette Randomly or starting from an initial color and following equidistant hues (0-360 in okLCH).
Start from your own palette, and then vary the colors in the palette preview.
